    /* however what happens when we update that array?
    now here is the problem!
    oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    
    So, how do we fix this? We take a COPY instead! */
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    team4[3] = 'heeee hawww';
    console.log(team4);
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person; // captain is just a REFERENCE to the original person object
    captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 }); // (emptyObject, object from which are copied properties and values, additional properties and values to the new object )
    console.log(cap2);

    // Object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };
    
    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes); // usung Object.assign it's going just one level deep so when we will change social.twitter or social.facebook it will change those values in the original object as well

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes)); // JSON.stringify(wes) return a string and then JSON.parse change it to the object. 
    // problems with performence... 
    // as well can be used deep clone but the best is to try using Object assign
